<br>
Hello and welcome to PlayTimeManager! I initially created this plugin for the server on which I am currently a developer. We don't have thousands or hundreds of players, but we had to find a way to track players' playtime to promote one whenever it reaches a certain amount. I looked around on the web, but I couldn't find any plugin that was able to satisfy our issue: we needed a playtime plugin, somewhat efficient, that could automatically execute a specific task like promoting a player through Luckperms. Well, that's what this plugin is supposed to do! <br> <br>
I thought this could be useful to other server administrators as well, so I decided to share it on Spigot! If interest arises, I'll keep it updated happily :)
