# PlayTimeManager - GUIs Configuration
# This file contains all customizable text elements for GUIs (will be added more in the future)
# Hex colors are supported with the following format: &#rrggbb
# where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are
# hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255)
# Standard minecraft colors and styles are accepted using & format (e.g. "&5&lTest").
