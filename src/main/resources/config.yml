#goal-check-rate sets every how many seconds a check will be made on online players to see if they have

#Define when the interval resets (in cron format)
#Format: <seconds> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week>
#I know it may seem a little difficult to understand, but it's very powerful and highly customizable.
#I suggest you to use this website if you need help: https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html
#Also ChatGPT is very useful in these cases :)
#Examples:
# "0 0 0 * * ?" - Daily at midnight (00:00) -> Use this if you want to implement rewards based on daily logins.
# "0 6 0 * * ?" - Daily at 6 AM
# "0 0 12 * * ?" - Daily at noon (12 PM)
# "0 0 0 ? * MON" - Weekly on Monday at midnight
# "0 0 0 1 * ?" - Monthly on the 1st at midnight
# "0/30 * * ? * *" - Every 30 seconds
streak-reset-schedule: "0 0 0 * * ?"

#Whether to use server timezone or UTC for cron scheduling
#Values: "server" or "utc"
reset-schedule-timezone: "server"

#If set to false the plugin will stop granting rewards, but will still continue to track players' join streaks
#Useful for maintenance of the rewards
rewards-check-schedule-activation: true

#Enable or disable debug logging in the console
#I suggest you to keep this true if you are experimenting with cron expressions defined above

# Enables or disables the reset of the join streak.

# %REQUIRED_JOINS% - Required joins to achieve the reward
# %PLAYER_NAME% - Player's username
# %MIN_JOINS% - Minimum required joins to achieve the first sub-reward, useful if the main reward is range based.
# %MAX_JOINS% - Maximum required joins to achieve the last sub-reward, useful if the main reward is range based.
